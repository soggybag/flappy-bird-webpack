# Falppy Bird Clone with Phaser 3 JS

This is a clone of the "classic" mobile game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird).

I built this starting from the tutorial [here](http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1). This tutorial uses Phaser 2 and builds everything into a single HTML file. While this is a great beginning tutorial I wanted to improve on the tutorial and dig deeper into Phaser. I converted the tutorial code to [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) and add Webpack with this [Webpack Phaser Starter Project](https://github.com/soggybag/phaser3-project-template).
